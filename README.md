<br>Ah yes emojis in argument channel names, roles, categories and voice channels it works bro it works
#### Commands
- :arrow_right: ``g.dc [argshere]``- Takes in 5 argument which are the channel mentions and delete them. ``[argshere] format``: separator ``whitespace``(space, not the actual word whitesace) for eg: ``g.dc #this-is-achannel #deletethis``

- :arrow_right: ``g.cc [argshere]``- Takes in 5 argument which are the channel names and creates them, no duplicate channels are allowed, in-case so, that argument wont be processed.  ``[argshere] format``: separator ``whitespace`` for eg: ``g.dc this-is-achannel deletethis``. Thanks to discord, as special characters are not allowed in channel name,I don't have to parse those yay

- :arrow_right: ``g.cr [argshere]``- Takes in 5 argument which are the role names and creates them, no duplicate roles are allowed, in-case so, that argument wont be processed, be sure to split argument with separator ``,``(comma) like for eg: ``g.cr this is a role with whitespace,thisisnot``

- :arrow_right: ``g.dr [argshere]``- Takes in 5 argument which are the roles name and deletes them,  like for eg: ``g.dr this is a role with whitespace,thisisnot``

- :arrow_right: ``g.ccat [argshere]``-Takes in 5 argument which are the categories names and creates them, no duplicate categories
are allowed, in-case so, that argument wont be processed, be sure to split argument with separator ``,``(comma) like for eg: ``g.ccat read me, annoucement``

- :arrow_right: ``g.dcat [argshere]``-Takes in 5 argument which are the categories names and delete them, be sure to split argument with separator ``,``(comma) like for eg: ``g.dcat read me, annoucement``

- :arrow_right: ``g.cvc [argshere]``-Takes in 5 argument which are the voice channels name and creates them, works in same way as other create modules like ``g.cc`` or ``g.ccat``, be sure to split argument with separator ``,`` for eg: ``g.cvc general, chill zone``
